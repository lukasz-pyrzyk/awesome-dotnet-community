# Awesome Dotnet Community

Inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [awesome-dotnet](https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet). After the acquisition of Twitter and its subsequent flooding with bots, the majority of developers migrated to other platforms. The goal of this repository is to help them reconnect.
